# w3school.mockup

This website was created in high school as a project for the course Web Programming. 
I attempted to create a scaled-down replica of w3schools.com. 
The project consists of six HTML files, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file. 
A simple website for learning Java is represented by five HTML files. 
One of the HTML pages depicts a forum, and the responses are handled by elements of the JavaScript file.
Bare in mind that many JavaScript features were mandatory for this class, even if they have no link to the project's concept.

This project taught me the fundamentals of website development. 
Especially, how crucial planning is. 
In the future, I intend to use what I've learned from this project to design more visually appealing and responsive websites.
